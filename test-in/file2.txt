[Chorus]
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars"

[Bridge]
Oh, take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

[Chorus]
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars"
Lately, I been, I been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But, baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said, "No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars"

[Outro]
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river the lessons I learned
